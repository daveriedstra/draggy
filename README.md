Draggy
====

Enable three- or four-finger drag on touchpads.

### Usage

Draggy will attempt to enable itself on all multitouch devices that can also send a click event (note that for the moment this means drawing tablets may be unsupported). Simply call `draggy` and it should Just Workâ„¢.

You can also pass it the path of the touchpad device to enable gestures on:

`draggy -d /dev/input/event14`

You can find the path with `libinput list-devices` (look for the device with the `gesture` capability, not necessarily the one with `Trackpad` in its name).

The script enables three-finger drag by default. Four-finger drag is available with the `-c` or `--count` option:

`draggy -c 4 -d /dev/input/event14`

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* [python-evdev](https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): `sudo pip install evdev` or install `python3-evdev` package
* libinput

The script also needs `/dev/uinput` access. To temporarily enable, run `sudo chmod 0666 /dev/uinput`. To permanently enable, copy `40-uinput.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d`, ensure your user is in the `uinput` group, and restart your machine. The `uinput` module is builtin to some kernels, but if yours does not include it you will have to load it with `sudo modprobe uinput`.

### Installation & Removal

The script runs fine in place, but for continued use you may want to set it to auto-start. There a number of ways to do this, below is a suggestion using systemd:

1. Copy `draggy` and `get_gesture_devices.py` to `/usr/local/bin`
2. Copy `draggy.service` to `/usr/lib/systemd/system`
3. Test the unit with `systemctl start draggy.service`
4. Enable the unit to run on boot with `systemctl enable draggy.service`

Removal consists of reversing the above steps:

1. Disable the unit with `systemd disable draggy.service`
2. Remove `/usr/lib/systemd/system/draggy.service`
3. Remove `/usr/local/bin/draggy` and `/usr/local/bin/get_gesture_devices.py`

### Supported devices

Draggy is tested & frequently used on these devices:

* 2013 MacBook Air
* ThinkPad T580 (`Synaptics TM3276-031`)
* Wacom Intuos PT S Finger

I don't currently have as much time as I'd like to field support requests, and I have limited hardware to test on. **However:** please file them anyway in the off chance someone else might be able to help or I come across the same hardware.

#### If it doesn't work for you...

If there are no errors and draggy still mysteriously doesn't seem to be working, try modifying the value of `CLICK_PRESSURE`. I haven't found a good way to infer what this should be from the reported device capabilities and at least on the Synaptics touchpad in my ThinkPad, it's... particular.
